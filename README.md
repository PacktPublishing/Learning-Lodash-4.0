# Learning Lodash 4.0
This is the code repository for Learning Lodash 4.0. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Lodash was built to simplify JavaScript application development. It contains hundreds of methods built for the purpose of providing developers with a fast, reliable, cross-browser toolkit to write applications. With Lodash, you can eliminate rewriting boilerplate code and focus on developing the features your users want.

This course takes you through the process of setting up, building, and scripting the deployment of a JavaScript application built using Lodash. Each section explores a new Lodash API, and employs methods within to build new application features.

First, we cover the origins of Lodash and how it has become an indispensable tool for JavaScript developers. We will also install our application and its dependencies. Then we’ll build out the features of an application to explore, create, and tag recipes. This includes building both an API in Node.JS and a client-side application using Lodash.

At the end, we’ll write a script to minify our application for deployment, and look at alternate deployment methods using Lodash CLI. This course will provide you with practical uses of Lodash in JavaScript development that you can apply in future applications. By the end of the book, you'll know the principles of building structured and modular applications using Lodash.
